        <h1>Applet</h1>

        <p>Applet are small special kind of java programs that run within a web document/web-page.They are accessed an internet server and transported over the network.<br>An applet is a small program which is embedded in an HTML page that can be automatically downloaded form web server and run in any java enabled lorows or hot java lorowser of java.Applet are automatically installed and run as a part of HTML document.</p>
        <ol>
            <b>The current use of applet includes following :-</b>
            <li>Animated graphics</li>
            <li>Video games</li>
            <li>On-line test</li>

                    <li>Applet application has no main() method.</li>
                    <li>Java Applet is only compiled. it is not executed by interpreter, because it has no main() method. It is only executed by browser.</li>
                    <li>Java Applet does not use the library of other language such as C and C++.</li>

        <b>Types of Applet :-</b>
        <ol>
            <b>There are basically two types of applet :-</b>
            <li>Local Applet</li>
            <li>Remote Applet</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Local Applet --></b>The applet which resides on local computer and also executer on same computer is called local applet.</li>
            <li><b>Remote Applet --></b>The applet which resides on remote computer such as web-server and executed on that computer is calleed remote applet.</li>
        </ol>
        <b>Creating user-define applet :-</b>
        <p>In java, auser define applet is a class which is derived from a by=uilt in class. Applet and overides the method of Applet class.</p>
        <p>The Applet class hierarchy in java is as following :-</p>
        <b>Applet Lifecycle :-</b>
        <p>There are following stages in lifecycle of applet :-
        <ol>
            <li>Initialieation state</li>
            <li>Running state</li>
            <li>Blocked state</li>
            <li>Display state</li>

        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Initialisation state :-</b>In this state, the applet is first loaded into the memory. It means initialisation state comes only once in applet lifecycle.
            <p>In this state, the public void init() method is automatically triggered/ invoked call.</p></li>
