    <h1>JAVA</h1>
    <p>Java is a pure object oriented platform independent programming language which is developed by <strong>James Gosling</strong> and <strong>Patrick Naughton in 1991 in Microsystems.</strong> It is mainly designed for electonic goods such as <strong>TV, VCRs etc.</strong> the initial name of Java is <strong>"oak"</strong> and launch its version java 1.0. The Sun Microsystem gives <strong>WORD(Write Once,Run Anywhare)</strong> Jaglina for java1.0 version.</p>
    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>In 1990, Sun Microsystems decide tondevelop special software thet can be used to manipulate consumer electonic devices. Ateam of <strong>Sun Microsystem programmers heade by James Gosling </strong>was formed ton under this task.</p>
    <p>In 1991, after exploring the possifility of using the most popular object oriented language <strong>C++</strong> the team announced a new language named <strong>"Oak"</strong>.</p>
    <p>In 1992, the team known as <strong>Green Projrct</strong> team by Sun, demonstrated the application of their new language to control a list of home application using a <strong>Hand Held Device</strong> with a tiny touch sensitive screen. </p>
    <p>In 1993, the <strong>World Wide Web (WWW)</strong> appear on the internet and transformed the ten based internet into a graphical-rich environment. </p>
    <p>In 1994, the team developed a web browser called <strong>"ot Java"</strong> to locate and run applet program on internet.</p>
    <p>In 1995, <strong>"Oak was renamed Java"</strong> due to some legel rnags.</p>
    <p>In 1996, Java established itself as a leader for Internet programming and also as a general purpose, <strong>Oop language.</strong></p>
    <h4>There are many version that has been released.
    <n> The version of Java are :-></n> </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>JDK Alpha and Beta(1995)</li>
        <li>JDK 1.0(1996)</li>

    <h2>Features/Buzzword of Java</h2>
    <p>Sun Microsystem officially describes java by given Buzzwords and that are as Follous :-</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Compiler & Interpreted</li>
        <li>Platform independent & Portable</li>
        <li>Object oriented</li>
        <li>Roburt & Security</li>
        <li>Distributed</li>
        <li>Simple & Small</li>
        <li>Multi-threaded</li>
        <li>High performance</li>
        <li>Dynamic</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li>Compiler & Interpreted:-<p>Java is both a compiled and an Interpreted language. Java translates  source code into bytecode instructions. As bytecode are not machine instructions. Java Interpreter genertes machine code that can directly be executed by the perticular machine that is running the Java Program. </p></li>
        <li>Platform independent & Portable:-<p>The most java programs can be earily moved from one computer to another, anywhare and anytime change and upgrade in OS, processors and system resources will not force any changes in java program.</p></li>
        <li>Object oriented:-<p>Almost everything in java is an object. All program code and data reside within objects and classes.</p></li>
        <li>Roburt & Security:-<p>Java provides many safeguard to ensure reliable code. It has strict compile time and run time checking for datatypes. Security is used for programming on Internet. Threat of virues and abuse of resources are everywhere. The absence of pointers in java ensures that program can't gain access to memory location without proper authorisation.</p></li>
        <li>Distributed :-<p>It is designed as a distributed language for creating application on network. It has ability to share both data and program.</p></li>
        <li>Simple & Small:-<p>Java is a simple and small language. Many features of C and C++ that are either redundant or sources of unreliable code are not part of java.<p><strong>For Example :- </strong>Java doesn't use pointers, preprocessor, header files, goto statements and many others.</p></li>
        <li>Multi-threaded :-<p>Multi-threaded means handling multiple task simultaneously. It means we need not wait for the application to finish one task before beginning another.<p><strong>For Example :-</strong> Listening sound clip while browsing a page at a time.</p></li>
        <li>High performance :-<p>Use of intermediate bytecode and multi-threading enhances the overall execution speed of java program.</p></li>
        <li>Dynamic :-<p>Java is capable of dynamically linking in new class libraries, methods and objects. It can also the determine the type of class through a query, making it possible to either dynamically link or abort the program, depending on the respons.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Types of java :</h2>
    <p>There are two types of java programs.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Application Program :-</li>
        <p>Appliction programs are stand-alone programs that are written to carry out certain tasks  on local computer such as solving equation reading and writing files. The application program can be executed using two steps.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compile source code to genreate bytecode using java compiler.</li>
            <li>Execute the bytecode program using java Interpreter.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Applet Program :-</li>
        <p>Applet are small java program developed for internet application. An applet located on listent compiler can be downloaded in internet and executed on a local computer using java capable browsen. The java applet can also be exexuted in the command line using applet-viewer, which is the part of JDK.</p>

    <h3>Diffrence between java and C++</h3>
    <div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>JAVA is a pure object oriented language.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>C++ is basically C with object oriented extension.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Bytecode</h3>
    <p>The Java compiler compiles the code for a machine that physically doesn't exits, there for a virtual machine. This compilerd code is known as bytecode and hypothetical machine is called java virtual machine(JVM).</p>
    <pre>Source(java file)   --->    Compiler(Javac)    --->      Bytecode(Class file)</pre>
    <p>Fig :- Process of compilation</p>
    <h3>Java Virtual Machine(JVM)</h3>
    <p>Java language is a plateform independent usually referred to as "write once run anywhere (WORD)". This is accomplished by the JVM that runs on the local machine, interprets the java bytecode and converts it into platform spccific machine code. The JVM is invoked dufferently depending on the types of java program. JVM performs the following function.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a class file is executed, JVM loads all requried classes automatically from the local disk or from across the network. This is the function of "class loader" utility of JVM.</li>
        <li>After loading the required classes JVM verifies to make sure that the classes do not violate any of the basic rules of java language. This is the function of <strong>"Bytecode Verifies".</strong></li>
        <li>Then JVM keeps track of all memory uses. It takes care of memory allocation and also performs the release of memory after the object is no longer needed. This process which manages dereferenced objects is caled Garbage Collection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Note :-</h4>
    <p>Within JVM, Just-in-Time(JIT) compilers are used to improve performance. JIT compiler translates bytecode only the first time. If repeated execution of the code is required, it is automatically mapped to the correspoding native machine code. This is especially effective in repetative code, such as loops or recursive functions.</p>

    </pre> 
    <h3>Java Development Kit(JDK)</h3>
    <p>Java environment includes a large number of development tools and hundreds of classes and methods. The devekopment tools are part of the system known as Java Development Kit(JDK).</p>
    <p>The major part of it comprises of software development kit (SDK). Java SDK 1.4 includes the following sets of tools.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Tools (javac, java, javadoc, appletviewer, jar, jdb, javah, javap, extcheck)</li>
        <li>Remote Method Invocation(RMI) Tools (rmic, rmiregistry, rmid, serialver)</li>
        <li>Internationalisation Tool(native 2 ascii)</li>
        <li>Security Tools(keytool, jarsinger, policytool)</li>
        <li>java IDL and RMI-IIOP Tools(tnameserv, idt, orbd, server tool)</li>
        <li>Java Plug-in TM Tool</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>Application/ Uses Og Java</h2>
    <p>
        According to Sun microsystems, 3 billion devices run java. There are many devices where java is currently used some of them are as follows :-
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Desktop application such as acrobat reader, media player, anti-virus, etc.</li>
        <li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
        <li>Web applications such as irct.co.in, etc.</li>
        <li>Mobile</li>
        <li>Embedded system</li>
        <li>Smart card</li>
        <li>Robotes</li>
        <li>Games ,   etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types of java applications :-</h3>
    <p>There are mainly four  types of applications that can be created using java programming :-</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stand-alone Application</li>
        <p>It is also known as desktop application or window-based application. An application that we need to install on every machine such as media-player, antivirus, etc. AWT and swing are used in java for creating stand alone applications.</p>
        <li>Web Application :-</li>
        <p>An application that runs on the server side and cheates dynamic page is called web application. Currently servlrt, jsp, struts, jsf, etc. technologies are used for creating web application in java.</p>
        <li>Mobile Application :-</li>
        <p>An application that is created for mobile devices Currently, android and java are used for creating mobile applications.</p>
